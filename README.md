42 Grade: 124/100 (Yes the max grade is 124 not 125 for some reason (in of June of 2025))

A simple game inspired by Temple Run.
This project is part of the 42 curriculum, aiming to explore graphics programming using OpenGL to create a 3D game.

The main goals of the project are:
- Using code from my previous project (scop) to create a 3D game
- Loading different meshes to build a decor

To compile and run this project you can just use make to create the binary file used to launch the program.
